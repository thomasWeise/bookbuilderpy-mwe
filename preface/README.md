# Preface {-}

Hello.
This is a Minimum Working Example for all the features provided by the [`bookbuilderpy` Tool Suite](https://github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuilderpy).
You can use this example as a blueprint for making your own books.

As an example for a citation, I cite my old book&nbsp;[@WGOEB].
This is then resolved to a BibTeX record in the file `bibliography.bib`.
You can now continue to read [@sec:theChapter].
