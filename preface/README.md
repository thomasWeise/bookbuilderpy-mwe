# Preface {-}

Hello.
This is a Minimum Working Example for all the features provided by the [`bookbuilderpy` Tool Suite](https://thomasweise.github.io/bookbuilderpy).
`bookbuilderpy` is available as Python package on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/bookbuilderpy/) as well as a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/thomasweise/docker-bookbuilderpy) containing all required libraries and tools (of which there are many).
You can use this example as a blueprint for making your own books.

As an example for a citation, I cite my old book&nbsp;[@WGOEB].
This is then resolved to a BibTeX record in the file `bibliography.bib`.
You can now continue to read [@sec:theChapter].
